# EcoMorph

**Automated morphological trait quantification for ecological research**

EcoMorph uses SAM3 (Segment Anything Model 3) to measure biological structures from images — insects, flowers, leaves, and more — without manual annotation.

## ✨ Features

- **Prompt-based segmentation** — Type "flower", "insect", "leaf" to segment any structure
- **Zero training required** — Works out of the box on any organism
- **Comprehensive measurements** — Area, dimensions, shape metrics, color analysis
- **Body part analysis** — Segment individual body parts (head, thorax, wings, etc.)
- **Reference scaling** — Convert pixels to real-world units (cm, mm)
- **Batch processing** — Analyze hundreds of images automatically
- **Publication-ready exports** — CSV data + PNG masks

## 📥 Installation

### macOS

1. Download `EcoMorph-macOS.dmg` 
2. Open the DMG and drag EcoMorph to Applications
3. First launch: Right-click → Open (to bypass Gatekeeper)

### Windows

1. Download `EcoMorph-Windows.zip`
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Run `EcoMorph.exe`

> **Note:** First run downloads the SAM3 model (~2GB). This takes a few minutes.
